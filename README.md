# mygitdiffviewer
This is so I can filter out which program to view/handle diffs from gitk's view diff button.



Status:
Not working. 
gitk passes arguments like this, not the filename as expected:

file:///home/x/Documents/git_repos/general/general_electronics/.git/modules/modules/2022/M-CAM-OV5640/.gitk-tmp.YrWprd/2/[a72fd759b4996a38570a67b465d987220135189e]

not sure what to do, pausing work.
